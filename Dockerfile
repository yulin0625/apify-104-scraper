# First, specify the base Docker image.
# You can see the Docker images from Apify at https://hub.docker.com/r/apify/.
# You can also use any other image from Docker Hub.

# Second, copy just requirements.txt into the Actor image,
# since it should be the only file that affects the dependency install in the next step,
# in order to speed up the build
COPY requirements.txt ./

# Install the packages specified in requirements.txt,
# Print a message if there are no requirements

 && pip install -r requirements.txt \

# Next, copy the remaining files and directories with the source code.
# Since we do this after installing the dependencies, quick build will be really fast
# for most source file changes.
